Michelle Obama,"
            Becoming
        ",4.9 out of 5 stars,"I eagerly anticipated this book for two reasons that don’t fit well together.  First, although I do not know the Obamas, I have several friends who are close personal friends of both Michelle and Barack (this results from my attending law school while Barack was teaching, and living in Chicago for some years thereafter).  Second, I am not particularly a fan of their politics, although I obviously have nothing against them personally.  Thus, I think I can offer an objective view of this book—and I found it both moving and worthwhile.What comes across most in this book is Michelle Obama’s lack of self-pity combined with clarity of vision.  I suspect this was a difficult book to write—she knew that whatever she wrote, somebody, and maybe a lot of people, would criticize her for it.  She therefore focuses quite a bit on what might be called practical insight and empowerment, rather than on settling political scores.  That’s probably a wise choice—after all, her husband’s terms as President showed that very few people were interested in political settlements or compromise.The first third of the book covers her childhood (“Becoming Me”).  Contrary to the stereotype of Democrats as the party of the elite, Obama’s childhood, at least, was working class.  She grew up in the lower middle class South Shore neighborhood of Chicago; her father was a boiler operator.  Obama grew up in a stable household where her parents made their high expectations clear, though family life had its challenges, especially her father’s falling ill with multiple sclerosis.  Still, she managed to go to Princeton, then Harvard Law, and then to work at the ultra-prestigious Chicago law firm of Sidley & Austin, where she met Barack (and where my wife worked, a few years after that time).  I started law school in 1991, when Barack had just returned to Chicago from Harvard; he was much talked about even before he began teaching at the University of Chicago, because a high-powered Harvard graduate did not often choose to return to community organizing, rather than working for a white-shoe firm like Sidley.  In contrast, Michelle Obama makes clear in this book she’s the organized, path-following one, who shows up on time, unlike her husband, which is probably why law firm life suited her better.These initial years with Barack form the second third of the book (“Becoming Us”); one can tell that Obama struggled with her husband’s political ambition, because being a political spouse always imposes tremendous costs on the one not running for office (and she is explicit she has no interest in herself running for office).  In fact, she talks at some length about the couples’ counseling they had to go through as a result, though it seems to have worked out for them!  All of this is quite interesting, and much more readable than the massive biography of Barack that David Garrow wrote two years ago, “Rising Star,” which defeated my repeated attempts to read it, by having far too much irrelevant detail.  Michelle Obama does not make that mistake here, for which the reader, or at least this reader, is grateful.Obama closes the last third of the book with what was probably the hardest part to write, “Becoming More.”  She talks about the stress, but also the opportunity to offer her vision, that being in the spotlight meant, and she criticizes Barack’s successor in office in no uncertain, but in measured, terms.  At the end, she remains optimistic, but one gets a little of the feeling that she isn’t certain her optimism is warranted.I have a lot of sympathy for Michelle Obama.  Every person in power, whether that power is direct or indirect, is always ultimately frustrated, but it must gall her to see the contrast between her husband and Donald Trump.  I think that she picked the right path of not making that the focus of the book, though.  She’s a grounded pragmatist at heart, or at least so it seems from this book.  And we could all use a lot more grounded pragmatism, so her contribution to public discourse with this book is (unlike many political autobiographies) both illuminating and valuable.","Publisher: Crown Publishing Group; First Edition edition (November 13, 2018)",Language: English,Hardcover: 448 pages
Rachel Hollis,"
            Girl, Wash Your Face: Stop Believing the Lies About Who You Are so You Can Become Who You Were Meant to Be
        ",4.7 out of 5 stars,"I don't understand all the hype about this book. Rachel Hollis's life experience is so near perfect and so far removed from that of the average woman, that there is almost nothing in this book that is actually relatable. She uses the following examples in her book:1. She dropped out of school at 19 to pursue her successful event planning business that catered to Hollywood celebrities.2. She had one intimate relationship outside of marriage. They broke up for two days. On the third day he professed his love and they ended up getting married.3. Although they have four children, she and her husband struggled with infertility for eight months.4. Hollis admits she has a mean streak and uses the example of making fun of a girl in high school for shaving her toes.5. Hollis also shares in the book that she peed her pants on a trampoline and had a cavity at one point.6. Almost every chapter talks about how she made the Forbes ""Top 40 Under 40 list"", runs her own multi-million dollar company, and is a ""good Christian girl"".Perhaps this book could be appreciated by women who have lived a very blessed and sheltered life. But for anyone who has ever had to deal with real life issues such as poverty, illness, abuse, depression, co-dependency, dysfunctional families, loneliness, etc. I recommend you look elsewhere because this book will come across as one long never-ending humblebrag. All eight women in my book club agreed that the book had a tone that was ""inauthentic"", ""judgmental"", and ""preachy"". If you want to read truly authentic, genuine work that sheds light on overcoming human imperfections and failings, I recommend reading Jeanette Walls, Cheryl Strayed, and Elizabeth Gilbert. These female authors have lived very imperfect lives - like most of us - and you will find their work far more relatable than this book which comes across as self-aggrandizing propaganda.  I ended up returning the book for a full refund, which I never do.Note: My original one-star review of the book (which 93 people found helpful in the first 3 days) was reported to Amazon and removed for not meeting ""community standards"" even though the tone was very respectful. I'm sharing this because it might help explain all the five-star reviews.","Publisher: Thomas Nelson; paper back edition (February 6, 2018)",Language: English,Hardcover: 240 pages
Mike Bayer,"
            Best Self: Be You, Only Better
        ",4.8 out of 5 stars,"I’m not a reader, but I couldn’t put this down and not in the cliche way. Each chapter left me wanting to know the next. I’ve since purchased several copies to give away to family and friends, and even strangers. Coach Mike’s approach to trials and tribulations and the idea of a best self, seems to be a solution for many situations we go through that otherwise lacked something that could be consistent and universal, but at the same time, individualized and specific to the person. I highly recommend this book. It’s also something that you refer back to and reread throughout your life and as there are changes or new challenges so you can keep it and it won’t sit on a shelf forever. It was new territory for me to truly dive into self-reflection, but definitely needed and probably necessary for you too.“There is a pervasive belief in society that people can’t change, not really. That is absolutely 100% untrue. If people couldn’t change, I’d still be penniless and addicted to drugs. If people couldn’t change, everyone would basically be doomed. I’ve seen people overcome all odds. People change. They did. You can.”If this doesn’t resonate with you, read it over and over again until it does. You won’t be disappointed.","Publisher: Dey Street Books (January 8, 2019)",Language: English,Hardcover: 352 pages
Marie Kondō,"
            The Life-Changing Magic of Tidying Up: The Japanese Art of Decluttering and Organizing
        ",4.4 out of 5 stars,"I'm somewhat of a self-help book addict.  I was browsing Pinterest one day and stumbled upon the ""konmari method"" and was intrigued, so I bought this book for kindle and read it in about an hour.  I always thought I was a very organized person (because everything I owned had a designated, labelled place and my house was always super clean), but after reading this book I realized I was nothing more than a skilled hoarder.  I locked myself in my house for 6 straight weeks (seriously, only came out for absolute necessary obligations and appointments) and decluttered the ever-living hell out of my house.  The only thing that slowed me down was waiting for every Tuesday to roll around when the big donation truck would come and haul off all my unwanted items, or waiting for every Monday for the trash collection.  I probably discarded well over 100 bags of clutter in that 6 weeks and earned over $400 selling the big-ticket items via social media, which I used to make my house prettier.  I also donated an entire trunk full of books, CDs, and DVDs to my local library.  My home's available storage used to be completely maxed out, and now I have empty drawers everywhere!  I also have no less than 40 completely empty plastic storage bins in my garage that were previously full of clutter (and the storage bins are the next thing that will be sold!).  Reading this book was life-changing.  While I didn't follow it to the T (I do not thank my socks for their service every day LOL), it is the best feeling in the world to look around a room and realize you love every single item in said room.  I no longer feel weighed down by ""stuff"".  I still have a few odds and ends to finish up in my house, but I'm about 90% done at this point and loving it.  I never knew getting rid of things could be so addicting.  I also never thought I was the kind of person who could ever throw away a photo, but by the time I got to the sentimental items category, I discarded an entire garbage can full of photos without hesitation and it felt great!",Hardcover: 224 pages,"Publisher: Ten Speed Press; 1st edition (October 14, 2014)",Series: The Life Changing Magic of Tidying Up
Tara Westover,"
            Educated: A Memoir
        ",4.7 out of 5 stars,"In the interest of full disclosure, I'm the Drew from this book, and although Tara and I are no longer together I’ve met all of the key figures in this book on many occasions. Although I don’t have as intimate a knowledge of growing up in the Westover family as a sibling would, I observed first hand everything Tara describes in the third part of the book and heard many stories about earlier events, not just from Tara, but from siblings, cousins, and her parents themselves. I find the claims of factual inaccuracy that have come up among these reviews to be strange for two reasons. First, in a post-James Frey (“A Million Little Pieces”) world, publishers are incredibly careful with memoirs and “Educated” was extensively fact checked before publication. Second, no one claiming factual inaccuracy can do so with any precision. While every Westover sibling, as well as their neighbors and friends, will have different perspectives and different memories, it is very difficult to dispute the core facts of this book. “Educated” is about abuse, and the way in which both abusers and their enablers distort reality for the victims. It’s about the importance of gaining your own understanding of the world so you’re not dependent on the narratives imposed on you by others. I’ve heard Tara’s parents attack schools and universities, doctors and modern medicine, but more importantly, I’ve seen her parents work tirelessly to create a world where Shawn’s abuse was minimized or denied outright. I’ve seen them try to create a world where Tara was insane or possessed in order to protect a violent and unstable brother. I was with her in Cambridge when Shawn was calling with death threats, then saw her mother completely trivialize the experience. For Tara’s parents, allegiance to the family is paramount, and allegiance to the family requires you to accept her father’s view of the world, where violence is acceptable and asking for change is a crime.","Publisher: Random House; First Edition edition (February 20, 2018)",Language: English,Hardcover: 352 pages
Delia Owens,"
            Where the Crawdads Sing
        ",4.8 out of 5 stars,"Cynic that I am, with a finely-tuned Inner Critic always on high alert, it is often difficult to relax and read a book for pure pleasure, falling into the story, walking beside the characters, feeling their sun on my arms, their cold rain on my shoulders, and their emotions reaching deep and catching hold.  When it happens, though, I treasure the experience, and for days, sometimes weeks afterward, I regret my return to the less-than-magical, the more mundane, and too frequently, the patently awful, books on offer.A glowing review by a friend whose opinion I generally respect enticed me to try this book, one which is really not the type I would select.  But I was interested in the North Carolina setting and the premise of a “wild child” living alone in the marshes.  So off I went, nose in my Kindle.I read the book in two days, reading late into the night, snatching time during the day between work and chores.  Actually, the chores fell by the wayside, except for feeding my puppies.  I was mesmerized, enchanted, wrung out, appalled, energized, and amazed.  I dislike that last, overused word, but sometimes it’s the one that works.  And when I finished, I knew this was a book I’d read again, several times, and would not easily forget.What made it so special to me?  First, the writing: effortless, flowing, lyrical, and clear.  I absorbed it without stumbling, without mentally substituting a better word, or revising sentence structure.  Nope.  It was perfect for the tale being told.Second, Kya: a child of wonder, pain, abuse, abandonment, determination, beauty, the sort more from within than without, and a resourcefulness most of us cannot imagine.  Kya’s no cliché, no feral child just waiting to be rescued and rehabbed by well-meaning but clumsy individuals.  She transcends those stereotypes by leaps and bounds, and when she chooses to interact with others, she does so on her own terms. I also found the transformation, subtle and something easily missed if you’re not paying attention, of Kya’s speech patterns as she grew up, losing the backwoods twang and limited vocabulary of her crazy and largely uneducated father, for an almost academic style resulting from the stacks and stacks of books she devoured.Third, the setting: marshes that are hardly the monochromatic sweeps of green and blue so favored by weekend painters to the tourist trade; lagoons swarming with color and critters; birds far more numerous and varied than the ubiquitous seagulls; fireflies [although North Carolina folks call them lightnin’ bugs] flickering on and off with their special mating codes above the marsh; mud that isn’t yucky but the habitat of insects and worms; and the ocean, the largest body of all, rolling on past the undulating marsh grasses, the switchback creeks, placid lagoons, and sugar-soft strips of sand.  You can see all this, feel it in the blistering heat of summer and the chill moist fog of autumn and winter, smell the briny sharpness and the unmistakable tang of marsh mud at low tide, and hear the calls of all the birds, the waves rustling and then crashing, the wind making dead grass clatter.  And what about taste?  Well, there are all those grits, seeming years of grits…As always, other folks have provided the obligatory precis of the story, so go read those.  I’ll simply say that the plot is not trite, it’s not one you could predict, or want to, I suspect.  Neither are the characters in addition to Kya, even though one or two wear the clothes of a cliché until they morph into something else.Now here is the true evidence of this book’s power for me: I found some jarring elements, me, the reader who demands absolute historical, social, and geographical accuracy, and I just didn’t care. But here goes.The crawdads of the title are freshwater creatures, so they would not be denizens of Kya’s briny/saltwater marshes.  No one in North Carolina would call them anything but crawfish; growing up in Raleigh, I played with crawfish in creeks and streams.  Crawdad is a name used by folks west of the Appalachians.  However, crawdads do indeed sing, according to Woody Guthrie.People who live along the coast in North Carolina small towns would never go shopping can’t in Asheville.  True, you could drive from Manteo on the Outer Banks to Murphy in the state’s western tip using US Highway 64 the entire way, but it would have taken some 12 hours in the.  Thus the references to Asheville as a destination for shopping struck a wrong note.  So did having Kya’s meeting with her publisher in Greenville.  People flying in from Big Cities Up North would have landed in Raleigh or Charlotte.  Greenville didn’t have an airport in the late 1960s/early 1970s.Finally, I can’t find but one, possibly two, spots along the Atlantic coastline where Kya’s marsh sanctuary could have been located, given the detailed descriptions of boating through creeks and lagoons to the ocean.  That did make me wonder if the author used her imagination without the assistance of a few topographical maps.But you know what?  These minor quibbles aren’t worth a star, or even the point of a star to me, who is from NC, or to anyone else.  Such is the beauty and power of this story.","Publisher: G.P.

Lysa TerKeurst,"
            It's Not Supposed to Be This Way: Finding Unexpected Strength When Disappointments Leave You Shattered
        ",4.8 out of 5 stars,"I know this author is a Bible teacher for a women's ministry, so I shouldn't have been surprised that this book is heavy on the teaching and light on story. I knew the broad outline of what was happening in the author's life -- ill health, divorce -- and was interested in hearing how she was doing. But, honestly, I believe memoir would have been a better way to tell her story.In this book, the author is so intent on teaching the reader that her own story takes a back seat. I would rather have heard more about her own personal struggle to come to terms with the circumstances of her life -- what she is learning, not what we should learn. It was difficult for me to empathize with her because the moment she shares something personal, she is off and running with the lesson. That, or she bounces off the painful revelations into silly stories about her medical exams and therapy sessions. When I closed the book, those were the passages I remembered, because they were vivid and specific. I had hoped the entire book would have this vividness. Without it, and without the emotional depth her story should have, the book doesn't have the impact it could have. I want to weep with those who weep, mourn with those who mourn, but the format of this book works against that desire.In this genre, called ""Christian Living,"" authors often attempt to teach by writing in vague ways they hope will allow any reader to apply the lesson to their lives. So, for example, in Chapter 8, the author builds her lesson around a comment by a friend that upsets her. But the author doesn't reveal what was said to her. How can I understand her overreaction without knowing what set it off? ""In the particular is contained the universal,"" James Joyce said. I wish more writers would take that to heart.All in all, this book will satisfy fans of Lysa TerKeurst, as it's written in her tried-and-true study format. But if you're looking for an indepth story of one woman's pain and how she is working her way through it, this is not that book.","Publisher: Thomas Nelson (November 13, 2018)",Language: English,Hardcover: 256 pages

        ",3.4 out of 5 stars,"I do like the easy-breezy style: casual beach pics + lots of white space!  Except when I say ""easy"" I mean it verges on a complete lack of content. It seems to follow the format of Ina Garten's books with its glossy pages and overall heft, and I like that. But really, this is an assembly manual for the total newbie - and those who don't know any better. Gwenyth has proven to have great palate for complex flavors, but those sensibilities are absent from these pages. Her book "" Its All Good"" was coauthored by Julia Turshen, so maybe I actually gave Gwenyth too much credit. ""The Clean Plate""  is all marketing and none of the blood sweat and tears that usually go into the making of a cookbook. I should also add -- it's really insulting to find recipes for cold cereal topped with fruit. I pre-ordered a book for myself, and sent one to a friend for Christmas...

I’ve tried official classic calligraphy and that was a nightmare. But then I started seeing a lot of stuff on Instagram and online about hand lettering and a new way of doing calligraphy. So my interest was definitely piqued. After quite a bit of research I found this book online and immediately bought it. I think this book is good for somebody like myself. A beginner with or without artistic talent. I bought myself a “Tombow  beginNer “ Kit with pen, pencil, eraser, etc. I also got myself a notebook that I could practice in. I must say I became particularly motivated after realizing I could do this. While I’m not going to post any images because nobody needs to laugh that hard. LOL I believe with some practice I can be kind of good. I could make pretty envelopes, make signs, etc. etc. goodness knows I will never have a career or 1 million followers on Instagram for my lettering skills, but it’s nice to learn something new and put the creative side of my brain to work. If you want to learn about lettering and hand calligraphy, amp up the way you write/draw your letters, further your skills, etc. this book is quite useful. If you are more advanced you might not get as much out of it. It may be a tad bit of a disappointment if you are definitely advanced/more creative than somebody like me LOL But it would definitely make a good gift for somebody who has shown interest in lettering/calligraphy. I was going to buy the e-book version but for something like this I really like having the book right there in front of me. Plus there is practice space in the book. After I’ve used up that space I go onto my grid styled black-and-white hard covered notebook. I like keeping everything in one notebook so as to watch my progression or regression if I wait too long in between practice sessions. So practice practice practice that’s the only way to make it to Carnegie Hall and that’s the only way to become a lettering guru!This company also puts out other books that are quite awesome","Publisher: Paper Peony Press (October 27, 2017)",Language: English,Paperback: 112 pages

        ",4.3 out of 5 stars,"""You can't judge a book by it's cover.""  We have all heard that.  When I saw CARROTS on the cover of a book for ketogenic dieting, I thought, well here we go again.  Everybody knows that carrots have too much sugar.  However, once you actually read the book (as well as looking at the delicious photos) you find a ketogenic diet gourmet gem.  They rightly state in the ""Foods to Enjoy"" table on page 8 that carrots can be included but ""only with moderation"".  The basic information regarding achieving a ketogenic lifestyle is brief, yet accurate.  The whole book tells you how to have ""Foods to Enjoy"" on your ketogenic diet.  The recipes chosen are diverse and simplified for our busy lives, yet delicious and adding that little bit of joy from a selection of self-prepared foods which taste real good. I enjoy the Blackberry-Chia Pudding (Frozen Blackberries from my backyard).So, with additional thought after writing this review, in this case we can judge a book by it's cover.  Delicious to look at, Delicious to read, and by following the ""made easy"" recipes, Delicious to eat.I highly recommend this book for those who have been following a ketogenic lifestyle for a long time to learn some new recipes to spice up our life, and to make life a little easier.  For those who are just in the contemplation stage, or who are ready to begin, this cookbook lives up to it's calling card in Chapter One:  ""Simple & Easy Ketogenic Cooking"".For those who want more of the ""science"" behind the ketogenic diet, it will be a good companion to the book ""The Art and Science of Low Carbohydrate Living by Phiney and Volek"".Reading and ""digesting"" this cookbook is a good way to start off the New Year on a ketogenic diet.  5 stars in my opinion.","Publisher: Rockridge Press; Spiral Bond Version edition (January 9, 2018)",Language: English,Paperback: 210 pages

            The First Conspiracy: The Secret Plot to Kill George Washington
        ",3.7 out of 5 stars,"One can be forgiven for speculating as to what might have happened to our thirteen colonies if George Washington had been murdered in the conspiracy detailed in this excellent work by Brad Meltzer. What might be even more salient, however, is what America did become because the great man was NOT murdered. Much of what America has become is owed to those who stopped the plot to assassinate the father of our country.Imagine yourself as a writer. Now, assume you have stumbled across some disjointed information that indicates an attempt to kidnap or murder the one key figure in America's quest for self-governance. What would you do?Brad Meltzer probably has a little more backbone than most of us. As for myself, I might have entertained the thought to try writing a novel on the topic. With novels, people are more forgiving than with nonfiction. But, honestly, I probably would have given up after fifty or so pages.So, I bought Meltzer's book, including the Audible Whispersync edition so I could listen to it when actually reading was not possible. How was it?Excellent. From the get-go I was fascinated by the prospect, if not so thrilled with some of the early statements.What I mean is that, early on, (for just one example), Meltzer states:'...This small, inexperienced, poorly equipped group of soldiers needs to stand up to what is probably the biggest and most powerful military force in the world. By any normal measure, they don’t stand a chance—and Washington knows this, just as he knows that with every decision he makes, thousands of young soldiers’ lives could be lost...'Meltzer, Brad. The First Conspiracy (pp. 1-2). Flatiron Books. Kindle Edition.So, why does this bug me? Perspective. Through eight years of conflict, the total number who were killed by the fighting was 8,000. Yes, that is thousands, but is far less than one might suppose. When Meltzer stresses thousand of young soldiers lives could be lost, I imagine, readers are likely to conjure up far larger numbers in their minds.Yes, I  know I am being a bit picky. I am merely trying to show how this otherwise terrific history falls short of being a great story for us today.The writing and editing are good.BOTTOM LINEI highly recommend this book for anyone interested in American colonial history. Remember to get the Audible edition and listen to it with you kids and/or parents.Four stars out of five.","Publisher: Flatiron Books; Reprint edition (January 8, 2019)",Language: English,Hardcover: 432 pages

It can only be used once and the book is a waste without the test.- The book itself is largely a description of the strengths measured by the test. It's a companion to the test and not something you wold read on its own, but it does a great job of bringing the test to life.- The test is worth the price of admission. It's 177 rapid-fire questions that reveal the top five themes, or strengths associated with your personality. Knowing these strengths is critical, because they are unchangeable traits that will enable you to succeed to your fullest potential.- I also purchased the Amazon recommended Emotional Intelligence 2.0.

Harper Lee,"
            To Kill a Mockingbird
        ",4.7 out of 5 stars,"The setting for this book is the fictional town of Macomb, Alabama in the mid 1930s. The narrator of the story is Jean Louise ""Scout"" Finch, a 10 year old tomboy. Her father, Atticus Finch, is a lawyer who is defending a black man accused of raping a white woman. The likelihood of a  black man getting a fair trial in the south in the 1930s is about 1 in a million...optimistically speaking.Scout gets some valuable life lessons from her father. She sees that doing the moral thing, is not always an easy, or popular, or safe thing to do.  But it's the <i>right</i> thing to do. She also learns that everybody deserves to be treated with dignity and to receive justice, no matter what their skin color.I first read TKAM in high school 50 years ago. I re-read it, as I'm sure many others have, in preparation for reading the recently published  ""To Set a Watchman"".  I was touched deeply by this story in 1967. And I'm touched just as deeply in 2017.  Harper Lee made us stare prejudice and injustice in the face, and made us want to aspire to be an Atticus Finch.

            Spark Joy: An Illustrated Master Class on the Art of Organizing and Tidying Up (The Life Changing Magic of Tidying Up)
        ",4.6 out of 5 stars,"Mari Kondo's first book covered her method pretty thoroughly, so I wasn't sure whether this one would be worth the purchase. If you aren't sure which to buy first, I would say the first book does a better job of explaining her attitude towards tidying and this book has better practical advice.In a nutshell, the konmari method involves getting rid of anything in your life that doesn't spark joy. Starting with clothes, you go through each item and decide what stays or goes based on whether or not it sparks joy when you hold it. Joy is the only criterion: 'If it makes you happy, then the right choice is to keep it confidently, regardless of what anyone else says.'The illustrations are charming, but there aren't very many of them. The most helpful shows her famous folding method, which is something I didn't understand simply from reading the first book. (Youtube videos helped.) This book has around 10 diagrams for folding dresses, shirts, odd-shaped clothes, camisoles, parkas, etc. Apart from the folding instructions, the other images are simply cute images of rabbits putting things away, a perfectly tidied closet, etc.One of the criticisms of the first book is that it seems geared mostly towards people cleaning up their own mess, and that hasn't changed. For example, the section on handling stuffed animals is talking about your own plushies, not your children's. I wish there were more discussion of handling items belonging to family members and how to inspire them to tidy up too. Family is covered in one small section, and the main advice is simply to set a good example and accept others – easier said than done!Overall this is a fun read but not substantially different from the first book. This book has more explanation of the original advice, but if you understood it the first time around, you may not need it. There is a lot of repetition between the two books. However, it's an enjoyable read and may give you that last bit of motivation to tidy up once and for all. In addition to the extra folding help, it has more specific advice about handling certain types of items such as greeting cards, dishes, photos, etc.",Hardcover: 304 pages,"Publisher: Ten Speed Press; Illustrated edition (January 5, 2016)",Series: The Life Changing Magic of Tidying Up

            The High Performance Planner
        ",4.3 out of 5 stars,"Unfortunately, I'll be returning the one I just received.My likes:1. Love the idea of combining morning/evening journal with a planner.2. 60-day ""sprint"" format is a plus vs quarterly or annual approach to create more urgency.3. Brendon's weekly, and monthly journal/planning questions are solid. What I like most is that the short-answer morning and evening journal questions are in your face every day on the daily plan pages. I can see this creating a helpful tail-wind to initiating and sticking with a daily journaling habit.4. Price is right; keeps it accessible for almost everyone. Quality appears to be sufficient so it will likely last the 60 days for which it is intended. But I would pay twice this much (and do) for a different planner.My dislikes:1. Way too much space allocated to the daily calendar on the daily plan pages.2. No meaningful space for top 3, other daily tasks. These were crammed in to remaining space on the pages.3. Morning and evening journal questions are good, but no additional space is available in the daily spread for additional journal writing or taking notes as the day progresses.4. Would prefer to see a 1-page index at the front of the journal, and for the pages to be numbered to support an index.5. The overall size of the planner is pretty large; the space on the 2-page daily plan spread could have been utilized much better.It would be great if Brendon Bouchard and Michael Hyatt (Full Focus Planner - the planner I currently use) would get together to create a hybrid.","Publisher: Hay House Inc.; Original edition (November 13, 2018)",Language: English,Diary: 192 pages
Wizards RPG Team,"
            Player's Handbook (Dungeons & Dragons)
        ",4.6 out of 5 stars,"I am going to try to not duplicate the information provided in most of the other 5 star reviews because I agree with the vast majority of them.  I am an oldster, have played every edition of D&D there has been, most of them being released when I was of legal drinking age, and IMO this is the best edition ever.  I have not been this excited about a version of D&D since 2nd edition was released.  It appears to me to have taken all the best, from a game design point of view, and most popular aspects of earlier editions and put them in one book.  Another way to think of it is that this edition is the most true to the game principles set forth in the earlier editions, especially AD&D 1st and 2nd editions, while at the same time carrying the more modern and popular principles from 3.5 and even the much maligned 4.0.I have to admit that I completely steered clear of the earlier play test versions, and was more than a little skeptical of the approach taken in getting feedback from so many play testers.  I was worried that we would end up with a ""too many cooks spoil the stew"" situation; a game that was a convoluted mish-mash of everyone's ""favorite rules"" creating an incoherent and largely unplayable mess.  I am pleasantly surprised to say that I was 100% wrong about the effectiveness of the play test process and the finished product.  Contrary to the opinions in some of the lower star reviews, what I am holding in my hands and have read cover to cover is a very ""tight,"" comprehensive, elegant, and fun set of rules.Who is likely to like these rules?  I think both the veteran player who cut his or her teeth on any version before 3.0, and a brand new player will like them.  The mechanics most definitely have a ""return to the basics that made the game great in the 70's and 80's"" feel, while at the same time keeping a more elegant version of the more modern mechanics, like feats, attacks of opportunity, etc., that people generally love from 3.0 and later editions.  For the most part, all of these things have been streamlined and made more elegant in application, but they are there.I will end with my favorite thing about this book.  A little background first to provide some context for my opinion.  And let me say that this is just my opinion and some will disagree with me.  For me, D&D started to trend downward in my enjoyment of the game at 2nd edition, and then it really did so at 3.0 and 3.5.  For me, although I did not have the strong dislike for 4.0 that many people did, it just was not D&D to me anymore, I think primary because I had cut my teeth so much on 1st edition and the Basic and Expert sets in particular.  D&D 5th edition has produced a steep positive trend for me for I think one general reason.  When playing even 2nd edition, but very much so for 3.0, 3.5, and even 4.0, I found myself interacting with my character in the game more as a playing piece than a character in a story.  Concerns about where to put skill points, and if a particular collection and order of choice for Feats began to dominate my thoughts and game choices.  It was almost as if my character, and my decisions about playing the character, began to be dominated more by my interface with the rules in the book, rather than with my ideas about my character and my interaction with the game world.  As my character advanced in level, I found that my focus on the book and what was written therein became more pronounced, not less as it did with earlier editions.  As I reflected while playing these later editions, I found that I was not really playing a character, but instead was playing a set of rules.  So far, the gift that 5th edition has given to me is a change in focus.  My character has again become a protagonist in an adventure story, rather than a playing piece.  I worry now more about the choices and decisions I make while interacting with the game world, and those choices making the character fun to play, rather than fretting over whether or not I have chosen the right Feats or if my modifier for a particular skill is as high as I want it to be.  The way that races, and even classes, are discussed, the used of a character's background and the ideals, personality characteristics, etc. that are randomly determined from the background choice, and the lack of mathematical modifiers except for the familiar ability modifier, and the soon to be ubiquitous global proficiency modifier, instead using the elegant advantage/disadvantage mechanic all have worked to focus my attention back on my character as protagonist.  For that I want to thank the play testers and writers of 5th edition.  For me this has been the most nostalgic aspect of the rules, not so much the mechanics per se.Do I like all of the rules?  Absolutely not.  Frankly, I think that is impossible to attain and do not expect that from any set of rpg rules.  To me that's not fair to expect that of the writers.  And frankly, I am not even looking for that in a set of rules anymore.  As I start down the path of the twilight of my gaming career given my age, I want a set of rules that provides enough structure that a DM can make consistent rulings on the fly that fit in with the general mechanics used in the game, and that foster my appreciation as a player of the development of my character in a game world where playing the game is smooth and produces memories of an interesting character who is the protagonist in an interesting story line.  Most importantly, I want a set of rules that stays out of the way of that process, and helps me to focus on the game aspects that will produce those kinds of memories.For me, D&D 5th edition, although not perfect, will accomplish this just fine.",Hardcover: 320 pages,"Publisher: Wizards of the Coast; 5th edition (August 19, 2014)",Series: Dungeons & Dragons

The rest of the recipes are below 500 calories.I enjoy the organizational format and the abundance of professional photos of most of the meals. You can get a good idea if the recipe is for you by photos alone and this has been well done just like her previous two cookbooks.She also has a “Skinny Scoop” commentary on the bottom of the page that offers information you may not have known related to the recipe or references how to use the recipe in tandem with another one of the recipes in the book.As always I appreciated the time taken to list a recipes nutritional information since I calorie count making it much easier for me in that effort.I’ve included photos of what I have made so far having only had this book for a few days and a photo of the so-called calorie offending one so many reviewers are criticizing as a departure from her previous publications.

Yuval Noah Harari,"
            Sapiens: A Brief History of Humankind
        ",4.6 out of 5 stars,"Harari primarily presents an hypothesis as to how Homo sapiens who successfully migrated out of Africa circa 70 kya (thousand years ago) and thereafter, successfully dominating the planet, differed from earlier Homo sapiens who attempted out migration previously (e.g. around 130 kya) but were not successful.  Keep in mind that Homo neanderthals in Europe and Homo erectus in Asia had climate and environment adaptations that sapiens did not have and were separate species.  Harari claims (assumes) that the later sapiens differed from the earlier sapiens in only one way.  They had evolved the ability to form an ""inter-subjective reality,"" as opposed to objective reality (physical) or subjective reality (in only one person's mind).  They were able to tell stories and believe them, independent of physical reality.Everything from myth to religion to nations to moral codes to money are inter-subjective realities according to Harari.  They have force in the physical world as long as people believe them, and cease to exist the moment people no longer believe them.  This explains how people could cooperate in groups larger than 150, giving them a military and security advantage, and encouraging specialization which eventually gave them a technological advantage.Moreover, Harari claims (assumes) all these later sapiens were genetically identical, and that the variations in societies are purely cultural, i.e. inter-subjective realities.  He presents history as an erratic evolution toward global unity, which is essentially demanded by the nature of inter-subjective realities, requiring belief of all those in mutual frequent contact, but he doesn't say how.In fact, Harari presents only anecdotal evidence for his claim.  He presents no empirical studies regarding the flexibility of humans toward inter-subjective realities, and no mathematical models of its development, evolutionary advantage, or stability.  He describes the scientific method as an important development, and requires it to include both mathematical models and verification of them.  But he does not use either in his treatise.  Thus he presents an important and interesting hypothesis, but not in a scientific manner.  He makes not even suggestions as to how to further formulate or verify it as a scientific theory.  Perhaps he is trapped in the inter-subjective reality of history as liberal arts, not science.The term ""intersubjective"" does exist in the literature of psychology and philosophy, primarily as a synonym for ""agreement,"" but there is no agreement about its definition (Gillespie and Cornish 2009, Journal for Theory of Social Behavior) state:""The  concept  of  intersubjectivity  is  used  widely,  but  with  varying  meanings.  Broadly  speaking,  we  take  intersubjectivity  to  refer  to  the  variety  of  possible relations between people’s perspectives. If we take social life to be founded on interactions  then  intersubjectivity  should  be  a  core  concept  for  the  social  sciences  in  general  and  understanding  social  behaviour  in  particular.  Perhaps because  of  this  broad  relevancy  research  has  been  fragmented  and  at  least  six definitions are in circulation. Most simplistically, intersubjectivity has been usedto  refer  to  agreement  in  the  sense  of  having  a  shared  definition  of  an  object.""The biggest complaint I have about Harari is that he does not distinguish between his opinion and facts, nor explain the background of how he arrived at the theory of inter-subjectivity.  The study of the evolution of cooperation is a hot topic, with political scientists, biologists, mathematicians and even physicists all having theories, and much data collected and many math models developed.  It is apparent Harari is aware of this, but does not tell us how his theory fits in.  I can only conclude he finds his powers of popular persuasion greater than his powers of scientific persuasion and critical analysis, so he writes a long book instead of a focused research paper.By the way, you can find excellent video summaries and reviews of this book on the web, and even a ""summary"" for sale as an eBook.  I originally got interested from the video summary.Near the end Harari reports on happiness research.  In this section of the book he takes exception to his usual approach, giving us descriptions of studies and names of researchers so we can trace where these conclusions come from.  The book is worth reading for this section.Occasionally Harari gets facts wrong.  You won't realize this unless you have investigated the matter separately.  I noticed it because his description of the origin of the caste system in India was wrong, according to current research.Harari tries to present himself as outside modern factions (or inter-subjective realities), such as nature vs. nurture, liberalism vs. conservatism, etc.  But without conscious explication, he suffuses his book with the assumption that any modern human if taken from birth is equally at home in any of the current or historical inter-subjective realities.  He does not propose or even consider experiments to determine culture-vs-genetics.  So he proposes this important genetic ability evolved in a small population on a single continent between 130kya and 70kya, but that no differentiating evolution has occurred since then.The question of whether the degree or style of inter-subjectivity is as universal as he implies is important for several reasons.  Harari proposes the world is ""different"" since 1945, with no war between major powers, no more empires expanding by territorial acquisition.  He suggests some reasons for this (cost of nuclear war, for example) which are unverified.  His book was completed in 2014 before Russia claimed parts of Ukraine and China claimed the entire South China Sea.  If inter-subjective capacity is universal, then this situation is likely unstable.  People could quit believing it at any moment, and the world could return to any state that it has been in historically.  If inter-subjective capacity is not identical in everyone, then it might make a great deal of difference which cultures dominate, even if through historical accident.  See for example Boyd and Richerson 2009 Culture and the Evolution of Human Cooperation.So, it is a book full of powerful ideas, often with carefully balanced arguments on both sides, but beware of accepting the background assumptions without critical thinking, or you will just fall into the latest meme.","Publisher: Harper Perennial; Reprint edition (May 15, 2018)",Language: English,Paperback: 464 pages

            Eleanor Oliphant Is Completely Fine: A Novel
        ",4.6 out of 5 stars,"Eleanor Oliphant is one of the most interesting characters that I have read in a while. She is blunt. Very blunt. She lacks social skills and tends to spout off facts to people just having conversations. She likes her routine. Every Friday, stop and buy pizza and vodka. And every Wednesday, she talks to her mother. Those are never very good for Eleanor. Her mother is mean and angry and leaves her feeling less than.  Something happened to Eleanor when she was a child. Something that left her with a scar on her face and moving from foster home to foster home. Does she remember it all or is it her coping mechanism? Things start to change in her life when her company’s IT guy, Raymond, and Eleanor help an old man who has passed out in the street. Family is the one thing that she has been missing.There is so much to Eleanor. In the beginning, I thought that I didn’t care too much for her but as time went on and she opened up, well, I fell in love with her. I would venture to say that she is on the autism spectrum. What a sad story she had lived and what a wonderful world opening up for her. Beautifully written and just a lovely story, you will fall in love with Eleanor too.","Publisher: Penguin Books; Reprint edition (June 5, 2018)",Language: English,Paperback: 352 pages

            The Greenprint: Plant-Based Diet, Best Body, Better World
        ",5.0 out of 5 stars,"THIS IS A GREAT BOOK !!! The book itself is very well written and easily broken down. No trouble with understanding how to do anything.  The book has very good recipes; even if you can’t cook you will easily be able to prepare these recipes. The meals are very healthy and nutritional as a Vegan I tend to focus on healthiness. I would certainly recommend this book for anyone who is already involved in Vegan cooking and also for anyone who is thinking about starting Vegan cooking. If you follow the recipes carefully enough your end result will look just like the meal images in the book. Don’t take my word for it, get the book and give it a try and you will see for yourself.  I would give it a 10 star if permitted.  GREAT BOOK !!!","Publisher: Harmony; 1 edition (December 31, 2018)",Language: English,Hardcover: 304 pages
