Michelle Obama,"
            Becoming
        ",4.9 out of 5 stars,"I eagerly anticipated this book for two reasons that don’t fit well together.  First, although I do not know the Obamas, I have several friends who are close personal friends of both Michelle and Barack (this results from my attending law school while Barack was teaching, and living in Chicago for some years thereafter).  Second, I am not particularly a fan of their politics, although I obviously have nothing against them personally.  Thus, I think I can offer an objective view of this book—and I found it both moving and worthwhile.What comes across most in this book is Michelle Obama’s lack of self-pity combined with clarity of vision.  I suspect this was a difficult book to write—she knew that whatever she wrote, somebody, and maybe a lot of people, would criticize her for it.  She therefore focuses quite a bit on what might be called practical insight and empowerment, rather than on settling political scores.  That’s probably a wise choice—after all, her husband’s terms as President showed that very few people were interested in political settlements or compromise.The first third of the book covers her childhood (“Becoming Me”).  Contrary to the stereotype of Democrats as the party of the elite, Obama’s childhood, at least, was working class.  She grew up in the lower middle class South Shore neighborhood of Chicago; her father was a boiler operator.  Obama grew up in a stable household where her parents made their high expectations clear, though family life had its challenges, especially her father’s falling ill with multiple sclerosis.  Still, she managed to go to Princeton, then Harvard Law, and then to work at the ultra-prestigious Chicago law firm of Sidley & Austin, where she met Barack (and where my wife worked, a few years after that time).  I started law school in 1991, when Barack had just returned to Chicago from Harvard; he was much talked about even before he began teaching at the University of Chicago, because a high-powered Harvard graduate did not often choose to return to community organizing, rather than working for a white-shoe firm like Sidley.  In contrast, Michelle Obama makes clear in this book she’s the organized, path-following one, who shows up on time, unlike her husband, which is probably why law firm life suited her better.These initial years with Barack form the second third of the book (“Becoming Us”); one can tell that Obama struggled with her husband’s political ambition, because being a political spouse always imposes tremendous costs on the one not running for office (and she is explicit she has no interest in herself running for office).  In fact, she talks at some length about the couples’ counseling they had to go through as a result, though it seems to have worked out for them!  All of this is quite interesting, and much more readable than the massive biography of Barack that David Garrow wrote two years ago, “Rising Star,” which defeated my repeated attempts to read it, by having far too much irrelevant detail.  Michelle Obama does not make that mistake here, for which the reader, or at least this reader, is grateful.Obama closes the last third of the book with what was probably the hardest part to write, “Becoming More.”  She talks about the stress, but also the opportunity to offer her vision, that being in the spotlight meant, and she criticizes Barack’s successor in office in no uncertain, but in measured, terms.  At the end, she remains optimistic, but one gets a little of the feeling that she isn’t certain her optimism is warranted.I have a lot of sympathy for Michelle Obama.  Every person in power, whether that power is direct or indirect, is always ultimately frustrated, but it must gall her to see the contrast between her husband and Donald Trump.  I think that she picked the right path of not making that the focus of the book, though.  She’s a grounded pragmatist at heart, or at least so it seems from this book.  And we could all use a lot more grounded pragmatism, so her contribution to public discourse with this book is (unlike many political autobiographies) both illuminating and valuable.","Publisher: Crown Publishing Group; First Edition edition (November 13, 2018)",Language: English,Hardcover: 448 pages
Mike Bayer,"
            Best Self: Be You, Only Better
        ",4.9 out of 5 stars,"I’m not a reader, but I couldn’t put this down and not in the cliche way. Each chapter left me wanting to know the next. I’ve since purchased several copies to give away to family and friends, and even strangers. Coach Mike’s approach to trials and tribulations and the idea of a best self, seems to be a solution for many situations we go through that otherwise lacked something that could be consistent and universal, but at the same time, individualized and specific to the person. I highly recommend this book. It’s also something that you refer back to and reread throughout your life and as there are changes or new challenges so you can keep it and it won’t sit on a shelf forever. It was new territory for me to truly dive into self-reflection, but definitely needed and probably necessary for you too.“There is a pervasive belief in society that people can’t change, not really. That is absolutely 100% untrue. If people couldn’t change, I’d still be penniless and addicted to drugs. If people couldn’t change, everyone would basically be doomed. I’ve seen people overcome all odds. People change. They did. You can.”If this doesn’t resonate with you, read it over and over again until it does. You won’t be disappointed.","Publisher: Dey Street Books (January 8, 2019)",Language: English,Hardcover: 352 pages
Rachel Hollis,"
            Girl, Wash Your Face: Stop Believing the Lies About Who You Are so You Can Become Who You Were Meant to Be
        ",4.7 out of 5 stars,"I don't understand all the hype about this book. Rachel Hollis's life experience is so near perfect and so far removed from that of the average woman, that there is almost nothing in this book that is actually relatable. She uses the following examples in her book:1. She dropped out of school at 19 to pursue her successful event planning business that catered to Hollywood celebrities.2. She had one intimate relationship outside of marriage. They broke up for two days. On the third day he professed his love and they ended up getting married.3. Although they have four children, she and her husband struggled with infertility for eight months.4. Hollis admits she has a mean streak and uses the example of making fun of a girl in high school for shaving her toes.5. Hollis also shares in the book that she peed her pants on a trampoline and had a cavity at one point.6. Almost every chapter talks about how she made the Forbes ""Top 40 Under 40 list"", runs her own multi-million dollar company, and is a ""good Christian girl"".Perhaps this book could be appreciated by women who have lived a very blessed and sheltered life. But for anyone who has ever had to deal with real life issues such as poverty, illness, abuse, depression, co-dependency, dysfunctional families, loneliness, etc. I recommend you look elsewhere because this book will come across as one long never-ending humblebrag. All eight women in my book club agreed that the book had a tone that was ""inauthentic"", ""judgmental"", and ""preachy"". If you want to read truly authentic, genuine work that sheds light on overcoming human imperfections and failings, I recommend reading Jeanette Walls, Cheryl Strayed, and Elizabeth Gilbert. These female authors have lived very imperfect lives - like most of us - and you will find their work far more relatable than this book which comes across as self-aggrandizing propaganda.  I ended up returning the book for a full refund, which I never do.Note: My original one-star review of the book (which 93 people found helpful in the first 3 days) was reported to Amazon and removed for not meeting ""community standards"" even though the tone was very respectful. I'm sharing this because it might help explain all the five-star reviews.","Publisher: Thomas Nelson; paper back edition (February 6, 2018)",Language: English,Hardcover: 240 pages
Lysa TerKeurst,"
            It's Not Supposed to Be This Way: Finding Unexpected Strength When Disappointments Leave You Shattered
        ",4.8 out of 5 stars,"I know this author is a Bible teacher for a women's ministry, so I shouldn't have been surprised that this book is heavy on the teaching and light on story. I knew the broad outline of what was happening in the author's life -- ill health, divorce -- and was interested in hearing how she was doing. But, honestly, I believe memoir would have been a better way to tell her story.In this book, the author is so intent on teaching the reader that her own story takes a back seat. I would rather have heard more about her own personal struggle to come to terms with the circumstances of her life -- what she is learning, not what we should learn. It was difficult for me to empathize with her because the moment she shares something personal, she is off and running with the lesson. That, or she bounces off the painful revelations into silly stories about her medical exams and therapy sessions. When I closed the book, those were the passages I remembered, because they were vivid and specific. I had hoped the entire book would have this vividness. Without it, and without the emotional depth her story should have, the book doesn't have the impact it could have. I want to weep with those who weep, mourn with those who mourn, but the format of this book works against that desire.In this genre, called ""Christian Living,"" authors often attempt to teach by writing in vague ways they hope will allow any reader to apply the lesson to their lives. So, for example, in Chapter 8, the author builds her lesson around a comment by a friend that upsets her. But the author doesn't reveal what was said to her. How can I understand her overreaction without knowing what set it off? ""In the particular is contained the universal,"" James Joyce said. I wish more writers would take that to heart.All in all, this book will satisfy fans of Lysa TerKeurst, as it's written in her tried-and-true study format. But if you're looking for an indepth story of one woman's pain and how she is working her way through it, this is not that book.","Publisher: Thomas Nelson (November 13, 2018)",Language: English,Hardcover: 256 pages
6th Edition Publication Manual of the…,"
            Publication Manual of the American Psychological Association, 6th Edition
        ",4.3 out of 5 stars,"I purchased this from MagicBook1234...perhaps that should have been my first clue. However, I purchased from them because they had the best price and the reviews for the seller seemed to be good...then I started working on my paper and found GLARING issues with the spiral copy of the manual I received.There is no way this is the approved manual. Perhaps a first run or someone horribly plagiarized the book.  Glaring issues are throughout. Ex: on page 67 of the spiral book: First sentence says ""mtending"" instead of intending. Same pg 1st sentence under section 3.08 states ""only what needs to be said"". This section starts with a lower case and it is not a complete sentence! Page 68 says ""10-year-olc*"" instead of 10-year-old. There are level 2 headings not bolded when most are. I could go on.

Marie Kondō,"
            Spark Joy: An Illustrated Master Class on the Art of Organizing and Tidying Up (The Life Changing Magic of Tidying Up)
        ",4.6 out of 5 stars,"Mari Kondo's first book covered her method pretty thoroughly, so I wasn't sure whether this one would be worth the purchase. If you aren't sure which to buy first, I would say the first book does a better job of explaining her attitude towards tidying and this book has better practical advice.In a nutshell, the konmari method involves getting rid of anything in your life that doesn't spark joy. Starting with clothes, you go through each item and decide what stays or goes based on whether or not it sparks joy when you hold it. Joy is the only criterion: 'If it makes you happy, then the right choice is to keep it confidently, regardless of what anyone else says.'The illustrations are charming, but there aren't very many of them. The most helpful shows her famous folding method, which is something I didn't understand simply from reading the first book. (Youtube videos helped.) This book has around 10 diagrams for folding dresses, shirts, odd-shaped clothes, camisoles, parkas, etc. Apart from the folding instructions, the other images are simply cute images of rabbits putting things away, a perfectly tidied closet, etc.One of the criticisms of the first book is that it seems geared mostly towards people cleaning up their own mess, and that hasn't changed. For example, the section on handling stuffed animals is talking about your own plushies, not your children's. I wish there were more discussion of handling items belonging to family members and how to inspire them to tidy up too. Family is covered in one small section, and the main advice is simply to set a good example and accept others – easier said than done!Overall this is a fun read but not substantially different from the first book. This book has more explanation of the original advice, but if you understood it the first time around, you may not need it. There is a lot of repetition between the two books. However, it's an enjoyable read and may give you that last bit of motivation to tidy up once and for all. In addition to the extra folding help, it has more specific advice about handling certain types of items such as greeting cards, dishes, photos, etc.",Hardcover: 304 pages,"Publisher: Ten Speed Press; Illustrated edition (January 5, 2016)",Series: The Life Changing Magic of Tidying Up
Ray Bradbury,"
            Fahrenheit 451
        ",4.4 out of 5 stars,"This is a must read book!!  But I will say that I have a totally different point of view to the story than what most, in fact, all the reviews and editorials I have seen.  I am not a bookworm and so the idea that books are gone is not an apocalyptic idea.  The book was written before the internet and the information age.  It is WHY the books are burned and WHAT the books represent that should open your eyes and minds while reading this book.If all you get out of this book is the ""removal"" of books from society to become more connected to our electronic devices I feel so bad for you.The point of burning the books is explained.  I might give just a couple of spoilers, but everyone knows the premise of 1984 and this book is similar.  It is so much more than about books.It is about censorship and the people wanting it.  The government has banned all printed material except for comic books, 3D pornographic magazines, ""good old confessions"" and trade journals.  All other printed material is deemed too offensive to someone.  So much in-fighting in society  because everyone claiming something offends them.  So to make everyone happy, the offensive materials are removed.  Because of the year this was written (1953) Ray Bradbury could have not envisioned the internet.  If he had, it would have been heavily censored also. In 1953 ideas and knowledge were shared through print as they had been for hundreds of years.According to the book, the people wanted the offensive materials removed.  Because everyone is offended by something then everything is offensive, it must all be destroyed.For me the novel rings true about how easily people are offended by another person's ideas, thoughts, actions, beliefs.  In the story those things are still allowed (they can't control what you think), but without being able to write them down ideas and thoughts die pretty fast.Ultimately the story is about freedom and not being so judgmental of others lest ye be judged.  If you look around today, 11/4/2017, this story has never been more relevant.  We have protests and attacks in the streets daily based on ideals and beliefs that clash with others. These clashes occur, rather than people going their separate ways and understanding that the beliefs and ideals of others are just as legitimate as their own.  Some groups would rather have a scorched earth policy and destroy everything they hold dear, as long as the other side loses everything as well.","Publisher: Simon & Schuster; Reissue edition (January 10, 2012)",Language: English,Paperback: 249 pages
